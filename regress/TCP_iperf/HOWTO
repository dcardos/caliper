This is a simple test for Caliper to precisely transmit TCP packets that are generated at Linux kernel using Iperf traffic generator.


Create the following topology:
host_A (nf2c0) ------- (nf2c0) host_B (nf2c1) ------- (eth2) host_C
host_A (eth1) ------- (eth1) host_C

(Note: host_B and host_C can be the same host)

host_A is the sender, host_B is a router to measure the packet inter-arrival times, and
host_C is the receiver.



------ Step 1: Host setups ----------
on host_B run:
./host_B.sh

on host_A run:
./host_A.sh

on host_C run:
./host_C.sh

Here we make the assumption that the following MAC address are correct:
Obviously, you need to change them according to your setup.



------ Step 2: Generate traffic ----------

Start iperf server on host_C by:
iperf -s -B 10.0.0.3


To capture the event packets, on host_B (the router), run:
pathtocaliper/lib/gulp -i nf2c0 > 1.pcap


To start iperf client on host_A run:
iperf -c 10.0.0.3 -t 100 -B 10.0.0.1 -i 1 -F /dev/zero 


To setup packet interarrival time, edit line 641 of:
pathtocaliper/driver/kernel/nf2_control.c
with the appropriate rate.
(double pacing_rate = 950; //Mbps)
The default rate is 950 Mbps.


------ Step 3: Verify packet inter-arrival times  ----------

Same as Step 3 in UDP test.
